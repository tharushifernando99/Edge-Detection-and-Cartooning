***Edge-Detection-and-Cartooning***

This repository contains Python implementations for two image processing tasks: Edge Detection and Cartooning of an Image using OpenCV and NumPy. The project is designed for group collaboration, with detailed documentation of workflows, Python code, and output images.

**Project Tasks**

*Task 01: Edge Detection*

Edge detection helps in segmenting images for data extraction by identifying sharp intensity changes. This task involves:
- Implementing the Sobel operator for edge detection.
- Applying Gaussian smoothing before edge detection to improve results.
- Comparing edge detection with and without smoothing to understand its significance.

*Task 02: Cartooning of an Image*

Cartoonization converts an image into a stylized cartoon-like representation. This process includes:
- Using a bilateral filter to smooth and reduce the color palette.
- Applying edge detection to outline key features.
- Combining these techniques to create a cartoon-stylized image.

**Project Requirements**
- OpenCV for image processing
- NumPy for matrix operations
- Matplotlib (optional) for image visualization
